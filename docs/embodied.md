# Embodied Artificial Intelligence

Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) refers to the implementation of artificial intelligence into **physical robots that interact with the real world**.

## Key Concepts

- Embodied AI combines **computer vision** and **machine learning**.  
- **Training process:**  
    1. **Pre-training:** on large datasets (web, real-world, synthetic data)  
    2. **Post-training:** synthetic data is used to test and refine the models  
    3. **Deployment:** the model is applied in real environments using computer vision, vision-language models (VLMs), and large language models (LLMs)  

- **Real-time interaction:**  
    - Agents take in **contextual information** from their surroundings.  
    - Process information, plan actions, and execute them using **actuators**.  
    - Behaviors respond to **continuous environmental stimuli**, adapting future inputs and actions for learning.  
    - The models are “intelligent”—able to **reason and adapt**.
