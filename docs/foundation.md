# Foundation Models in Robotics
Implementation of foundation models requires pre-training on datasets to allow for higher generalization and adaptability:

- Robots learn value functions to determine lowest cost, optimal movements  
- High-level understanding of language-driven tasks  
- Zero-shot deployment from simulation-based training  
- Cross-embodied transfer of capabilities  

---

## Current Challenges
- Scarce access to data  
- Not all models are able to perform in real-time  
- A model that can generalize across all tasks and environments does not exist  
- Robots lack the ability to truly combine all “senses” to create the perfect behavior
